Dear 
The report was very good and well written.
My feedback for the individual phase:

1. Random initialization of the population does not necessarily lead to diverse population and you need to check it via variance.  
   You can also use crowding or islands 
	Explicit approaches to diversity maintenance based on measures of either
	genotype or phenotypic space include 
	- Fitness Sharing (Sect. 5.5.3), 
	- Crowding (Sect. 5.5.4), and 
	- Speciation (Sect. 5.5.5), 
	all of which work by affecting the probability distributions used by selection
	
	Implicit approaches to diversity maintenance based on the concept of algorithmic space include 
	- Island Model EAs (Sect. 5.5.6) and 
	- Cellular EAs (Sect. 5.5.7).

2. You could test different values for probability of cross over and mutation and population size and k...

3. In the beginning generations it is good to have a large probability of mutation alpha with larger intervals to swap but towards 
   the end it needs to be smaller both in probability and the interval not to destroy the good solutions you have. 

4. in the beginning generations for large data sets you can have a large k but as you go towards the end you can make it smaller. 
   Then it can converge faster. 

5. for stopping criteria you could consider the mean fitness as well. 

6. The early convergence can be because of initial population, elimination and crossover. 
   The last can make the effect of first two worse. 

7. If you check each time whether the link between two cities is infinity or not, the timing of your code will be terrible. 
   However, you can treat the link with length infinity like other links, 
   and the tour length which has a link infinity in it will have a length infinity. 
   This tour will disappear soon from your population.

Kind regards
Sahar
